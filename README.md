Refactoring code and meeting Accessibility standards

For this activity (homework) i have refactored the code for the HORISEON website. I have paid close attention to the following and refactored in the following order.

1. HEAD - I gave a TITLE which is concise and descriptive.

2. STRUCTURE - I gave the BODY of my code a structual order of HEADER, MAIN, ASIDE and FOOTER. This has made it easy to navigate through the different sections of the webpage when inspecting the code.

3. SEMANTIC ELEMENTS - I tried to use the most semantic elements which i believed were the most fuctional for example I replaced most of the DIV's in the code with SECTION'S and also inserted a NAV element to name a few.

4. ACCESSIBILITY - I attached ALT tags to all images on my website to meet standards.

5. CSS - I simplified the structure of the CSS style sheet to help improve the readibility and maintenance.

Please preview a screenshot of my website below and a link to my application.
